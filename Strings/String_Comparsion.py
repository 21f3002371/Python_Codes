# ASCII value of A = 65

#String Comparison will be through ASCII comparison
#Even if one character is not same, the two strings are not same
print('Hello' == 'hello') #Returns False
print('Hello' != 'hello') #Returns True
print('Hello' < 'hello') #Returns True (lexicographically comparing)
# Same as for <,>, <=, =>
